Excel just isn’t built for that scale.\n\nKey reasons in simple terms:\n- Scale and performance: Excel has row limits and memory constraints. SQL databases and Python data tools are designed to process large data efficiently.\n- Data integrity and governance: Databases enforce rules and keep data in a central, auditable place. Excel files can get out of sync and messy.\n- Reproducibility and automation: SQL scripts and Python notebooks can be versioned, shared, and rerun automatically. Excel steps are often manual and error-prone.\n- Transformation power: SQL shines at filtering, joining, and aggregating big tables. Python (pandas, Dask) handles complex wrangling and later modeling.\n- Collaboration: Code in SQL/Python + version control works well for teams. Excel files are harder to track changes in.\n- Ecosystem: Rich libraries, connectors, and tooling exist for SQL and Python (data cleaning, ML, dashboards). Excel is more limited in these areas for big data.\n\nWhen Excel is fine:\n- Small datasets (well under Excel’s limits).\n- Quick ad-hoc checks, pivots, or lightweight dashboards.\n- Prototyping or learning, before moving data to SQL/Python workflows.\n\nQuick guideline:\n- Extract and summarize large data with SQL.\n- Do cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling with Python.\n- Use Excel only for small, quick inspections or presentations.\n\nIf you want, tell me about your data size and tools you have, and I’ll suggest a simple start plan."
