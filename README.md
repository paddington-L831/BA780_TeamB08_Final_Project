This project explores how socioeconomic disadvantage, spatial inequality, and neighborhood-level characteristics interact to shape crime distribution across Boston. Using open-source datasets from the Boston Police Department and the U.S. Census Bureau (ACS), we analyze how poverty rates, median household income, and district-level crime density correlate geographically.

Through data cleaning, geospatial mapping (Folium and GeoPandas), and statistical correlation analysis, the study visualizes the spatial concentration of crimes and highlights strong overlaps between high-poverty areas and crime hotspots. The findings show that economic inequality—not merely geographic proximity or population density—plays the decisive role in driving crime concentration, particularly in central and southern Boston districts such as Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan.

By integrating socioeconomic and crime datasets, and employing tools such as heatmaps, choropleth visualizations, and regression-based comparisons, the analysis provides actionable insights into how structural disadvantage, spatial clustering, and socioeconomic context collectively shape patterns of public safety and community well-being across the city.
